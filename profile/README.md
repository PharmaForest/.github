**-Goal-**  
Through SAS Packages, we want to actively encourage sharing of SAS know‚Äëhow that has often stayed within individuals. By doing this, we aim to build up collective knowledge, boost productivity, ensure quality through standardization, and energize our community.

**-Priority-**  
Our first priority is to share openly‚Äîand get others to share as well‚Äîso that more people can join in. On that basis, we‚Äôll work on improving quality, driving standardization, and creating long‚Äëterm value.
