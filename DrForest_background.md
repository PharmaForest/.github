## (Japanese version) Forest, Morio（フォレスト森男）：
1960年1月1日生まれ（この時点では名前はフォレストのみ）．
魔法とプログラミングが同一の理として存在し，現代社会の文明科学と魔法が混ざったような世界において、かつて世界に厄災をもたらした竜を禁断のSASマクロ%dragonで封じたが，
その際に引数として友の命を指定したことを悔やみ，そのマクロを封印し，二度とSASマクロは使わないと誓いをたて自らに封印術式をかけた．人知れずひっそりと余生を送っていたところ，
ある日突然，phuse Japan OST WGによりSASマクロ%heroで異世界召喚された．なお，%heroを使った代償により召喚者は後日尿管結石で地獄の苦しみを味わった．  
Forestはその昔，元来は神族・魔族しか理解できなかったSAS Packageの構造を解き明かし，万人が使えるように体系化した．
またSASPACer（SAS Package使いの総称）として弟子の一人が世に広めた忘れられた魔法と言われていたハッシュオブジェクトも現代の魔法体系に組み込んだが，
その際，マージしかみとめない王立協会に命を狙われ顔に傷を追う．ハッシュオブジェクトの体系化は弟子の代で完成する.さらに，旧来の人間魔法の主流であるProc reportに異を唱え，
世にODSTABLEを広めたことから元老院と対立し，命を狙われる（顔に刻まれた傷をさらに増やすこととなる）．
召喚された異世界ではSAS Packageの存在はすっかり忘れ去られており，マスターBartが古文書を解読して現世に蘇らせたものの，SASPACer（SAS Package使い）はほんとに数えるほどしかいなかった．
これを聞いたフォレストは驚き，そして悲しみに打ちひしがれたが，彼を召喚したphuse Japan OST WGの一人にかつての弟子の魂を感じ取り，
懐かしい気持ちを思い出すとともに再びSAS Packageで世界に平和をもたらすため，召喚主らが属する医薬分野に特化した弱小ギルド「PharmaForest」のガーディアン（守り人）となり，
自らは封印術式はされたままではあるがその叡智を捧げることにした．"森男（もりお）"は，日本に根を下ろすこのギルドに早く馴染めるようにとつけられた．  

## (English version) Forest, Morio (Forest Morio):
Born on January 1, 1960 (at that time known only as “Forest”).
In a world where magic and programming coexist as one and where modern civilization and sorcery are interwoven, he once sealed away a dragon that had brought calamity to the world by using the forbidden SAS macro %dragon. However, because he had specified his friend’s life as an argument to that macro, he deeply regretted it, sealed the macro away, and swore never to use SAS macros again—placing a sealing spell upon himself.
He lived out his days quietly, away from the public eye, until one day he was suddenly summoned to another world by the phuse Japan OST WG through the SAS macro %hero. As a consequence of using %hero, the summoner later suffered the hellish agony of a kidney stone.  
Long ago, he had deciphered the structure of SAS Packages—once comprehensible only to divine and demonic beings—and systematized them so that anyone could use them. As a SASPACer (a term for SAS Package wielder), he also integrated the once-forgotten magic of hash objects, which one of his former disciples spread, into the modern magical system. Yet, for this very act, he was targeted by the Royal Association, which recognized only merging, and he received a scar on his face. The full systematization of hash objects was completed in his disciple’s generation.
Furthermore, by opposing Proc Report, the mainstream of traditional human magic, and popularizing ODSTABLE, he came into conflict with the Senate, which led to further attempts on his life—leaving even more scars upon his face.
In the world to which he was summoned, the existence of SAS Packages had been completely forgotten. Master Bart managed to revive them by deciphering ancient texts, but only a mere handful of SASPACers remained.
Hearing this, Forest was struck with shock and profound sorrow. Yet, within one of the members of the phuse Japan OST WG who had summoned him, he sensed the soul of his former disciple. Filled with nostalgia, he resolved once more to bring peace to the world through SAS Packages. Though his sealing spell remained intact, he devoted his wisdom to them, becoming the guardian of the small guild “PharmaForest,” a guild dedicated to the pharmaceutical field.
The name Morio (“Forest Morio”) was given to him so that he could more easily take root and blend in within this guild that had set its foundation in Japan.
