## What is SAS Packages?  
PharmaForest is a repository of SAS packages. These packages are built on top of **SAS Packages framework(SPF)**, which was developed by Bartosz Jablonski.  
For more information about SAS Packages framework, see [SAS_PACKAGES](https://github.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES).  
You can also find more SAS Packages(SASPACs) in [SASPAC](https://github.com/SASPAC).

# How to use SASPACer? (quick start)
Create directory for your packages and assign a fileref to it.
~~~sas      
filename packages "\path\to\your\packages";
~~~
Enable the SAS Packages Framework (if you have not done it yet):

~~~sas      
%include packages(SPFinit.sas)
~~~
(If you don't have SAS Packages Framework installed follow the instruction.)

When you have SAS Packages Framework enabled, run the following to install and load the package:


~~~sas      
/* Install and load SASPACer */
%installPackage(SASPACer, sourcePath=https://github.com/Nakaya-Ryo/SASPACer/raw/main/)   /* Install SASPACer to your place */
%loadPackage(SASPACer)
/* Enjoy SASPACerðŸ˜„ */
%ex2pac(
  excel_file=C:\Temp\simple_example.xlsx,
  package_location=C:\Temp\SAS_PACKAGES\packages,
  complete_generation=Y
)
~~~
You can learn from the following training materials by Bartosz Jablonski for source files and folders structure of SAS packages.<br>
